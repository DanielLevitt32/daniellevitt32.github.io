	<p>Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and MetLife were among several prominent U.S. companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association last week, after 17 people were shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The latest episode in America's bloody history of guns injected another layer into an already complicated issue and forced corporate America to pick a side.</p> 
	</p>

	<p>The morality of businesses' associations with the NRA was thrust into the public sphere in 2012, when 27 people &#8212; 20 of whom were children between the ages of six and seven &#8212; were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Pressure continued to percolate for years, hitting the headlines every time another deadly incident occurred. It appears that the Parkland shooting &#8212; already the 34th of its kind in the U.S. in 2018 &#8212; was enough to finally infiltrate the arteries of some of the world's largest companies.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately the first two months of this year haven't been an anomaly. Last year, mass shootings &#8212; defined as all shooting incidents in which four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire &#8212; happened on 200 days, or almost 60 percent of the calendar year.</p>

	<p>Outrage aimed at NRA-funded politicians followed by little to no action has become a routine in the aftermath of shootings in recent years. The NRA has been too big and too powerful for gun control campaigners to make any headway for change. But that's where this latest chapter is different from the rest.
	</p>

	<p>In a <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2521" target="_blank">Quinnipiac University</a> poll conducted last week, support for a number of gun control measures reached an all-time high from American voters. The Parkland shooting is not the first to target school children, nor is it the deadliest. But as public opinion on gun control moves into new territory, the status quo has begun to crack.

	<p>Interest in gun control unsurprisingly spikes immediately after a mass shooting and normally lasts for xxx days. But two weeks after Parkland and internet searches for gun control remain above average. In the social media era &#8212; Twitter's monthly users have almost doubled to 330 million since 2012 &#8212; activists have found a way to keep the topic of stricter gun control laws in the public conversation.

	<p>The gun control debate will inevitably cool down as each week passes, but the fact that corporate America has started to switch tack and act is cause for optimism for the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9341021e-1818-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44" target="_blank">#NeverAgain</a> movement and anyone pushing for stricter gun laws.</p>
